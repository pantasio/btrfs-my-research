```
lsattr file
---------------------m file
```
list attribute of file. **m** A file with the 'm' attribute is excluded from compression on file systems that support per-file compression.

#### ATTRIBUTES
**C**
A file with the 'C' attribute set will not be subject to copy-on-write updates. This flag is only supported on file systems which perform copy-on-write.
(Note: For btrfs, the 'C' flag should be set on new or empty files. 
if it is set on a file which already has data blocks, it is undefined when the blocks assigned to the file will be fully stable.
If the 'C' flag is set on a directory, it will have no effect on the directory, but new files created in that directory will have the No_COW attribute set. If the 'C' flag is set, then the 'c' flag cannot be
set.)
